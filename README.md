Doing swerve in the summer.

## Part 1 - June 6th
Started with a 20 minute presentation about what is Swerve.<br />
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UlFns79VPLa6JWTARuPIhunhoWoVWEZtnUoII4OY9Xs/edit?usp=sharing

The last 2 slides have some instructions which are copied below:<br />
1. Clone SwerveSummer2022 and make a branch with your name as the title
2. Setup 2 CANSparkMax objects in SwerveModule.java<br />
           -  Set PIDF+IZone to 0 for now. We will tune them on another day.
4. Complete setDesiredState method and getSteeringAngle method in SwerveModule.java

Check out this PDF for a guide to which CANSparkMax settings need to be set.<br />
